# Marqeta's OpenAPI Definitions

This repository contains [OpenAPI 3.0](https://www.openapis.org) definitions for [Marqeta's API](https://www.marqeta.com/docs/core-api/introduction). Marqeta's OpenAPI description files enable code generation (including SDKs), test cases, and documentation. These files are fully annotated, and Marqeta generates public API reference documentation from them. 

This project is in Beta. We expect the descriptions to be accurate, but we do not currently provide support for their use. We welcome your feedback: [Marqeta's Developer Community](https://community.marqeta.com/).
